**Project Description**
=====================
- Name: [Better Parallel Planning with MoveIt 2](https://moveit.ros.org/events/2023-google-summer-of-code/#better-parallel-planning-with-moveit-2)
- Mentors: Sebastian Jahr, Jafar Uru√ß

  - **Enable parallel planning in the move_group interface**
  - **Make parallel planning usable in RVIZ Motion Planning Panel**
  - **Visualize different parallel planning solutions in RVIZ**


**About me**
=====================
I am currently studying in Riga Technical university, in a Masters programe "Intelligent Robotic Systems", in the second semester. I currently work half-time as a research assistant in the Institute of Electronics and Computerscience in Riga, where I have been constantly studying robots and working with them for the past 4 years, mostly using ROS and MoveIt, with both C++ and Python. Working on different tasks, I have made multiple applications using the UR5 and UR5e robots, most notable of them being a pick-n-place application for two different objects with two robots working in the same workspace, where I was responsible for making the whole two robot setup work. That included:
 - making the whole .udrf/.xacro setup for both of the robots to be in the same workspace,
 - figuring out a calibration system for two robots (which is based on a hand-eye calibration programe for one robot, which I made using Python, PyQt5 for GUI etc.)
 - managing each robots tasks, which was done with state machines, using SMACC
 - creating and managing different actions for each robots, such as moving to defined and undefined positions, actuating both parallel and vacuum grippers and so on.

From this task I also made my proffessional Bachelor's thesis "Research and development of multi industrial robot collaborative systems" for which I got a 10.

Besides my experience, I am very interested in robotics and programming and I really want to learn contributing to open-source projects. I like to take up tasks that make me grow and use my braincells.

**Homework**
=====================
- Study ROS 2 and MoveIt 2, read MoveIt 2 concepts
- Get familiar with open-source contributions by doing 1-2 "good first issue"'s
- Study the "parallel planning API for moveit_cpp"

**Plan**
=====================

- Steps
  1. **Enable parallel planning in the move_group interface**:

- Support I need from community:: discuss with mentor in case of query.

**Timeline**
=====================

## Official overview

- **May 4**: accepted GSoC contributor projects announced;
- **May 4 - May 28**: community Bonding Period | GSoC contributors get to know mentors, read documentation, get up to speed to begin working on their projects;
- **May 29**: coding officially begins;
- **July 10 - July 14**: Midterm evaluation;
- **July 14 - August 21**: work Period | GSoC contributors work on their project with guidance from Mentors;
- **August 21 - August 28**: final week.

## Details

- **before May 4**
  - communicate with mentors to understand the details and goals of the project;
  - do the homework

- **May 4 - May 28**
  - active research about the project

- **July 10 - July 14**
  - prepare for phase 1 evaluation

- **July 14 - August 21**
  - work...

- **August 21 - August 28**
  - code style and quality review, dev documentation
  - prepare for final evaluation

**Why me**
=====================
I have been working with ROS and MoveIt for some time now and I am already working with ROS 2 and MoveIt 2 starting this year onwards. I am very interested in robotics, that's why I chose the only not-so-industrial robotics course in Latvia that I could find. Using ROS 2 and MoveIt 2 is directly connected to the tasks I do at my workplace and will definitely be connected to my Masters thesis, which will be due summer 2024. All of these are high priority reasons for why I will be very motivated to work on this project. Also I have experience working with ROS, MoveIt, C++, move_group_interface, move_group etc., but I lack the experience with contributing to open-source projects, which includes lack of knowledge about cody styling and documentation, which all are directions I want to improve on greatly. Overall I am knowledge hungry and I feel like, if I can contribute back while also learning a lot myself, it's the perfect opportunity!
